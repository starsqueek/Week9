/**
 * Implementation of sorted binary trees.  The interface is defined in {@link binaryTree.BTree}.  {@link binaryTree.TreeNode}
 * provides an implementation of binary tree nodes, and {@link binaryTree.BinaryTree} is a <i>partial</i> implementation
 * of the {@link binaryTree.BTree} interface.
 *
 * However, many of the methods in {@link binaryTree.BinaryTree} are only provided as stubs.  For the logbook you
 * should fully implement these methods.
